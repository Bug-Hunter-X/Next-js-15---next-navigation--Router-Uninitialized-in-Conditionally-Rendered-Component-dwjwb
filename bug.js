In Next.js 15, a subtle bug can occur when using `next/navigation`'s client-side routing functions within a component that's conditionally rendered.  If the component containing the navigation function isn't initially rendered (due to a conditional check, for example), the `router` object might not be properly initialized, leading to unexpected behavior or errors like `TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'push')`.
